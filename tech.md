## 1. General 

### 1.1. How does Arcology solve the scalability issue?

Arcology is revolutionary system that targets some deeply rooted of existing blockchain system designs. Arcology is a comprehensive solution to the scalability issue. Arcology solves scalability issue by introducing some groundbreaking features to the blockchain designs.

### 1.2. What are major advantages of Arcology?

 * Unmatchable performance
 * Transparency
 * Composability
 * Concurrent call the same contract

### 1.3. Is Arcology EVM compatible?

Yes, Arcology is EVM compatible. You can use Ethereum tools, wallet, and development environments on Arcology seamlessly.

### 1.4. Is Arcology an Ethereum L2 solution?

No, Arcology is a L1 scaling solution. It is an independent blockchain built from scratch.

### 1.5. How is it different from the Sidechain/L2 solutions?

L2 rely on different sidechains to achieve parallelism, but on the same sidechain everything is still happening in the serial order. In addition, L2 solutions lack composability, which is critical for many applications. Arcology’s parallel processing doesn’t rely on sidechains, and it is fully composable. On top of that, Arcology is also much more scalable. Compared with L2 solutions, Arcology is:

 * Composable
 * Consistent
 * More scalable

### 1.6. Why do you focus on a L1 solution?

No matter how many layers are built on top of each other, it is still down to the base layer to process transactions and store data. The base layer is the backbone of blockchains. The scalability of individual nodes determines the overall throughput of a network.  Arcology offers a solid design with unmatchable scalability.

### 1.7. How fast can Arcology run?

There is no theoretical limit on how fast Arcology can run. The throughput is more of a matter of resources.  Arcology is a “multithreaded” system that guarantees to take full advantage of all the resources available.

### 1.8. Do you have a ballpark estimate for the TPS?

A properly configured system will give you 250 ~ 300 TPS / core when running smart contract calls like CryptoKitties. So with 64 cores, you may expect somewhere between 16k/S ~ 19k/S. Node clusters will give better throughput.  

### 1.9. What is a node cluster?

The node cluster is deployment mode in which a group of interconnected machines working together as a single node on Arcology network.

### 1.10. How is a node cluster different from a node?

Arcology allows multiple interconnected machines (physical / virtual) to share the workload of a single node. Node clusters on Arcology act just like nodes on the other network.

### 1.11. What is the major benefit of having node clusters?

Intra-node Scalability. There is always an upper limit on how many processors and memory a machine can possibly have. A cluster-enabled design can effectively remove that constrain. With this design, more computational power or data storage can be dynamically added to the nodes on fly.

### 1.12. Does Arcology have its sharding solutions?

Yes, our sharding solution is called self-organizing, which will be completed in our next phase of development.  Arcology is powered by our concurrency framework, which works both in intra-node and inter-node scenarios. Our sharding solution is built on top of it.

### 1.13. What consensus algorithm does Arcology use?

Arcology’s consensus algorithm is named Multifactor PoS.

### 1.14. What is the Multifactor PoS?

Multifactor PoS is an upgraded version of the standard PoS algorithms. Conventional PoS algorithms only take coin staking into account, whereas Arcology uses multiple factors to determine validators qualification. Coin staking is still an important factor but no longer the only one.
